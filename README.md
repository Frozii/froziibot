# octetbot, a simple IRC bot in C
**ATTENTION! Not yet finished and under development.**

### What is octetbot?
octetbot is an IRC bot im trying to work on in order to learn about sockets and other things in C.
it's very small and can only do simple things for now.

### Current features?
* Uses very simple parsing in order to get configuration settings from a file
* Is able to connect to a server and a channel
* Responds to the servers PING requests in order not to get kicked for inactivity
* Can store channel activity into a log file

### TODO
```text
[X] Find a solution for cleaner log file output
[] Think about more complex tasks for the bot, .tell, .lastseen etc.
```
